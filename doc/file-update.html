<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Update the main file</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>If you run <b>meuporg -u</b>, it will "update the main file". This means
that meuporg will read the main file, deduce the files it should
parse, parse them to get all the items it finds and then insert these
in the main file.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Configuration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>The main file<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.1" href="#fn-.1">1</a></sup> must contain a basic configuration for meuporg: it
has to have a line with "!INCLUDE!" followed by a space separated list
of pattern and another with "!EXCLUDE!" followed by a (possibly empty)
list of patterns.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The files whose name contains a string matching at least one of the
   patterns in the list following "INCLUDE" will be parsed. If you
   left items in other files, they will be ignored.

</li>
<li>The files whose name contains a string matching at least one of the
   patterns in the list following "EXCLUDE" will <b>not</b> be parsed. If you
   left items in these files, they will be ignored.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Exclusion has the priority: if you include files containing "cpp" but
exclude those containing "bla" then <i>bla.cpp</i> will be ignored. The
regex's you use must follow the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html">python re package</a> syntax.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Templates</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>You don't need to start your main file from scratch as meuporg
provides templates for all its supported formats: org, markdown and
vimwiki. To create a main file in the current directory, simply run
</p>


<pre class="example">meuporg -t &lt;file_format&gt;
</pre>

<p>
where <b>file_format</b> is either "org", "md" or "vimwiki".
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Listing items</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>To tell meuporg where it must insert the list of the items it found,
just add a heading with name "Items" anywhere in your file. Keep in
mind that the text in this heading will be discarded when the file is
updated. The rest however is untouched. If you don't want to add a
specific heading for them, you can add "!Items!" on a new line. The
items will be inserted after it.
</p></div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Sort items</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>Meuporg does not simply list the items you left in a directory, it can
also sort them when inserting them in your main file. Suppose you have
two directories for your project: <i>doc</i> and <i>src</i>. You might want
meuporg to put items found in the <i>doc</i> folder into one part of your
main file and those found in <i>src</i> in another. Or perhaps you want all
and only the items whose name match "Some[0-9]+[^regex]" or
"Some\W*Other[Re]gex" contained in files whose names contains "src"
but doesn't match "src[0-9]+" and with a description that does not
contain the string "ni". I have no idea why you want that, but meuporg
can do it for you.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Guiding principle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<p>Items can be sorted into disjoint <b>groups of items</b>. A group is
defined by a <b>criteria</b> which can be arbitrarily complex. Note that an
item can only belong to <b>one</b> group, namely the first it fits in.
</p>
<p>
A criteria is either the conjunction or the disjunction of a list of
criteria, or a pair (attribute, regex) an item must match. They are
represented using a simple LISP-like syntax. For instance, a criteria
can be <b>(file_name el$ py$)</b>, in which case all items in file whose
name ends with <b>py</b> or <b>el</b> are matched. It could also be
</p>


<pre class="example">(and (name Some[0-9]+[^regex] Some\W*Other[Re]gex) (and (file_name src) (not (file_name src[0-9]+))) (not (description ni)))
</pre>

<p>
in which case the items in this group are all those matching the crazy
condition defined before.
</p>
<p>
A criteria set for a section of your file (i.e. what is below a given
heading) holds for all the subheadings.  You can think of your main
file as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve">sieve</a>: an item must match <b>all</b> the criterias of its parent
headings to appear somewhere in the file.
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Simple sort</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">

<p>If you simply want to sort items depending on the name of the file,
the syntax is simple. Meuporg builds a criteria from the headings of
the different parts of the main file. It is hopefully easy to
understand with an example.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you have this directory tree:
</p>


<pre class="example">.
|-- meup.org
|-- doc
|    |-- updateDoc.sh
|    |-- html
|
|-- src
     |-- foo
          |-- bar.cpp
          |-- bar.hpp
          |-- stuff
               |-- some_class.cpp
     |-- external_lib
          |-- external_lib.hpp

</pre>

<p>
with the following content in your main file, meup.org:

<p>
which,  if you are still not familiar with org-mode (what's wrong with
you?), looks like <a href="org-after.png">that</a>.
</p>
<p>
What happened when we updated the file?
</p>
<ol>
<li>meuporg parsed it and looked for the !INCLUDE! and !EXCLUDE!
   items. It deduced that files with name ending with cpp, hpp or md
   are to be parsed but that, however, those ending with .o or
   containing the string external<sub>lib</sub> are to be ignored.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.2" href="#fn-.2">2</a></sup>

</li>
<li>Then, meuporg parsed all the interesting files and created a small
   database of all the items.

</li>
<li>After that, it started again to parse the main file, looking at
   each line.
<ul>
<li>If the line is a heading, it checks if it has a criteria (either as
     ":file<sub>name</sub><sub>parts</sub>:" or as a !Criteria! item followed by LISP-like
     description in the next line). The current criteria is updated.

</li>
<li>If the line is a heading with first word "Items" or if it
     contains a !Items! item, items matching the current criteria are
     to be inserted right after this line. To know how to display the
     items, it looks at the word following "Items" or "!Items!"  which
     should have one of these values:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b>: Items are to be sorted by name.
</li>
<li><b>directories</b>: a directory tree containing all the files with
       items matching the criteria is displayed. Links to the
       different folders and files are added with "=&gt;" as their
       descriptions. The depth of tree is minimized: if the items are
       in files \/path\/to\/file1 and \/path\/to\/file2, the output is
       not



<pre class="example">* path
** to
*** file1
    &lt;items&gt;
*** file2
    &lt;items&gt;
</pre>

<p>
       but rather
</p>


<pre class="example">* ./path/to/file1
  &lt;items&gt;
* ./path/to/file2
  &lt;items&gt;
</pre>

</li>
<li><b>linear</b>: Items are printed in the order in which they were
       found.

</li>
</ul>

<p>     If no word is specified, the default behaviour is to sort items
     by their names. Everything until the next heading is discarded;
     this is to remove old items but be sure to not leave important
     info there.
</p></li>
</ul>

</li>
</ol>


<p>
Thus, when meuporg encountered the line "!Items! directories", it took
all the remaining items in files whose name contain <b>both</b> "src" and
"cpp" and printed the directory tree of these files.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Possible usage</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">

<p>The fact that items appear only once can be used to sort the items
depending on the task they correspond to. For instance, if you want to
separate the code corresponding to your tests from the rest in your
main file, you can create the following heading:
</p>


<pre class="example">* Tests
  !Criteria! (or (file_name test) (name TEST))
  !Items! directories
</pre>

<p>
In this case, all the items in files containing the name "test" in
their path will be printed as well those with name TEST (nothing
prevents you from having !TEST! items indeed). These items will be
printed in a way showing in which part of the directory tree they are.

<div id="text-footnotes">
<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.1" href="#fnr-.1">1</a></sup> Some may argue that such a configuration belongs in another
file. They have a point but I consider that describing the files that
are part of the project and those that are not is useful not just for
the program but also for anyone working on the project. I thus decided
to include this info <b>in</b> the main file.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.2" href="#fnr-.2">2</a></sup> Backup files, i.e. those ending with either "~" or "#" are
ignored by default. So are hidden files, i.e. those with names
