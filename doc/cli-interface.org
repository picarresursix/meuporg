in a directory is the *meuporg* command. Run it without any arguments
to see the help. The main options you can give it are the following.

   'md', 'vimwiki' or 'org'. Creates a new meuporg main file in the
   said format in the current directory (see [[Templates]]).

 + *-f*: (main File) Returns the path to the main file of the
   directory (if any).

 + *-u*: (Update) Updates the main file ruling this directory (it
   might be in the parent directories).

 + *-e TO_EXCLUDE*: (Exclude) Decides which file pattern(s) to
   exclude from the search. Repeat to specify several regex to
   exclude. Default behaviour is to exclude no file (but the backup
   and hidden ones).

 +  *-i TO_INCLUDE*: (Include) Decides which file pattern(s) to
    include in the search. Repeat to specify several regex to
    include. Default behaviour is to include every file (but the
    backup and hidden ones).

   folder in org-mode format.
