<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Purpose</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>  If you never encountered these, you may throw the first stone.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ever started a project, <b>left it aside</b> and took it again
    weeks/month/years later without understandig what you did? 
</li>
<li>Ever managed a <b>big</b> project on your one, the kind that involves a
    hundred pages of LaTeX and/or thousands of lines of code?
</li>
<li>Ever wondered <b>where</b> the hell that awesome info you found on the
    net was?
</li>
</ul>


<p>
  These are problems I have faced. I now do keep a track of the links
  I found using emacs'org-mode but the files where I put these where
  basically a mess. Furthermore, I didn't have the courage, when
  writing some file, to go to the org-one, write what I had to do, put
  a link to the file I was working on, go back to the file I was
  working on. Besides, the order I tried to put in my tasks by
  classifying them using headings and such was highly unstable: what I
  had to do was fixed but how I want to tackle it is not. None of
  these problems is a big deal but it is the kind of tiny things which
  get in the way and become even more annoying as they add up.
</p>
<p>
  Meup.org is the solution I came up with. It is a sort of standard in
  the way I "work"<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.1" href="#fn-.1">1</a></sup> and it is based on three things.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple way to document what I do and <b>what is left to do</b>
    intended to be as little cumbersome as possible; which implies
    having tools to automate annoying tasks.
</li>
<li>Having a schedule/subdivision of my tasks as flexible as possible;
    which also implies having tools to automate the update.
</li>
<li>A good software to manage todo lists and documentation with
    hyperlinks and that is good to take quick notes in plain-text. I
    use emacs'org-mode; I heard vimwiki is a nice substitute if you
    are that kind of person. I threw markdown in the mix because,
    well, why not?
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Behold&hellip; !Meup.org!</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>To solve these problems, I came up with meuporg, aka !Meup.org!, aka
!M!. While the choice of software to manage todo lists is left to you,
meuporg is the software to find what's left and display it nicely.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Overview of meuporg</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>It is a set of automatic tools to extract items from the content of
any text files you want and which sorts and inserts them in your todo
list regardless of the format you use<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.2" href="#fn-.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
It is assumed you have a unique file for each project at the root of
its directory tree in which you will put your todo lists, knowledge
base, etc. This file is called the <b>main file</b>. Personnaly, I now go
back to the main file of my projects at least every 10-15min when I am
working: it helps me know where I am going and I update it very
regularly because of that<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.3" href="#fn-.3">3</a></sup>. Meuporg updates this file
automatically by inserting links to the very lines I have to
modify/where I have to write functions/whatever and putting these
links in the relevant part of the main file.
</p>
<p>
A file like <a href="org-after.png">this</a>, where everything in underlined blue is a clickable
link to a task you need to do can be generated in no-time.
</p>
<p>
How can this be? you ask. Very simply, I shall answer. Right below,
you will find instructions explaining how to install meuporg. Then,
you will have more explanations about how it works and how it is
intended to be used.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Should I use meuporg?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">


<p>
If you don't work with plain-text files; that is if you work with an
office suite such that libreoffice.org, microsoft office or whatever,
then no. If your projects are not scattered on many files and are of
very small size, then probably not.
</p>
<p>
If you work on projects that are spread throughout several
weeks/month/years due to their sizes or the amount of time you can
spend on them and/or if the said projects consist in editing text
files[],fn:8 then <b>yes</b>, you might want to give meup.org a try!

<div id="outline-container-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Install</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">

<p>Just go <a href="http://picarresursix.github.com/meuporg/">here</a>, download the archive, uncompress it and run the
<b>./install.sh</b> script (tested on ubuntu and mac OS). Advices are
given: you might want to add this alias to your .bashrc
</p>


<pre class="example">alias meuporg="python2.7 '$BASE_DIR'"'
</pre>

<p>
(*/$BASE_DIR/ will be replaced by the value you should put when
running the script) and, if you are wise enough to use emacs, adding
this to your .emacs would be a good idea
</p>


<pre class="example">(load "~/.emacs.d/meuporg.el")
</pre>

<p>
(the <i>meuporg.el</i> file is automatically moved in your .emacs.d folder
during installation).
</p>
<p>
Run the following command to "activate" your bash alias.
</p>


<pre class="example">you@yourcomputer~$ . .bashrc

<div id="outline-container-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> List items</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<p>The main feature of meuporg is its ability to keep track of what is
left to do from the content of your text files and put it in your todo
list automatically. The principle is very simple: all you have to do
is leave some particular snippets of text anywhere and meuporg will
find them, sort them and add them to a file with links pointing to
them.
</p>
<p>
The snippets of text you must put in your files ar called <b>items</b>. An
item is something like the content of the comment at the beginning of
the loop in this hypothetic file <b>src/myfunction.c</b>.
</p>


<pre class="example">int foo(unsigned int bar)
{
        while (fuzzy_condition(bar))
                // !CHECK! The loop condition in foo may not work if
                // ! bar &lt; 10.
        {
                process_bar();
        }
        return -4;
}
</pre>


<p>
An item always has the following structure.
</p><ul>
<li>It always starts with a word enclosed in exclamation marks; this
   word is the <b>name</b> of the item. Only numbers and letters are
   allowed, so no space, no underscores, etc.
</li>
<li>An item can be "in-code", in which case it contains no other
   information than its name because the data surrounding it is
   sufficient.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.4" href="#fn-.4">4</a></sup> It is the case if there is at least one alpha-numeric
   character on the same line before it.
</li>
<li>&hellip; Or it can have a description. The description of an item is
   what follows it on the same line. If you need more than one line,
   just start the next one with an exclamation mark.
</li>
<li>An item is also defined by its <b>location</b>, i.e. the file it is in
   an its line number. However, this is taken care of automatically.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
In the example above, the item has these properties:
</p><ul>
<li>name: CHECK
</li>
<li>description: "The loop condition in foo may not work if some bar
   == 0".
</li>
<li>location: ./src/myfunction.c, line 5.
</li>
</ul>


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Types of items</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">

<p>The names of the items you can use are limitless: what defines and
item is that its name is enclosed between exclamation marks, nothing
else. Thus, if you want to have items called
"ImThinkingOfDoingThatButPerhapsItsNotSuchABrightIdea1644934", meuporg
can deal with it.
</p>
<p>
However, I suggest you use the following items:
</p><ul>
<li><b>todo</b>: When you need to start a new task: function to write, LaTeX
  table to insert, etc.
</li>
<li><b>continue</b>: When you already started something but need to continue
  it.
</li>
<li><b>improve</b>: When something is finished but could be improved.
</li>
<li><b>check</b>: When something should work as is but could use a
  verification.
</li>
<li><b>fixme</b>: When something does not work or is wrong.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
I also use a specific item when I write LaTeX code called "FIXREF". I
leave inside the text &mdash; i.e. it is not in a comment &mdash; as its
context is all the information I need. This allows me to separate them
from the other items in the main file (see <a href="file-update.html">file update</a>).

<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> File update</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">

<p>One of the main features of meuporg is its ability to insert the items
it found in a file: not only will they all be in the same place, you
can also organize them easily in an arbitrarily complex way! See
<a href="file-update.html">this page</a> for (a lot) more details.

<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> CLI interface</h3>

<p>Meuporg can also be used from the command line. A description of its
use is easily obtained by running it without any argument (or with
"-h"), but more details are given on <a href="cli-interface.html">this page</a>.

<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.2" href="#fnr-.2">2</a></sup> As long the format you use is either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode">org-mode</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2226">vimiwki</a> or

mail and I'll see what I can do. Even better: give it a try an
implement it yourself! The code is on <a href="https://github.com/picarresursix/meuporg">github</a>.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.3" href="#fnr-.3">3</a></sup> That's actually one of the nice "side-effects" of meuporg:
since I spend a lot of time in the main file, I feel a lot more the
urge to keep it updated, in particular when it comes to maintaining
the knowledge base I put in all my main files.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.4" href="#fnr-.4">4</a></sup> I use a lot of such items named FIXREF when writing papers. I
don't need to put them on their own lines with explanations as for the
reference I need to insert: the context is sufficient.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.5" href="#fnr-.5">5</a></sup> By the way, if you write a plugin to integrate meuporg with
your editor of choice (vim?) or IDE or what not, let me know and I
will be happy to provide a link to it or to integrate it to meup.org.
