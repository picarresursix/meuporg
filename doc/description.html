<p>
  If you never encountered these, you may throw the first stone.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ever started a project, <b>left it aside</b> and took it again
    weeks/month/years later without understandig what you did? 
</li>
<li>Ever managed a <b>big</b> project on your one, the kind that involves a
    hundred pages of LaTeX and/or thousands of lines of code?
</li>
<li>Ever wondered <b>where</b> the hell that awesome info you found on the
    net was?
</li>
</ul>


<p>
  These are problems I have faced. I now do keep a track of the links
  I found using emacs'org-mode but the files where I put these where
  basically a mess. Furthermore, I didn't have the courage, when
  writing some file, to go to the org-one, write what I had to do, put
  a link to the file I was working on, go back to the file I was
  working on. Besides, the order I tried to put in my tasks by
  classifying them using headings and such was highly unstable: what I
  had to do was fixed but how I want to tackle it is not. None of
  these problems is a big deal but it is the kind of tiny things which
  get in the way and become even more annoying as they add up.
</p>
<p>
  Meup.org is the solution I came up with. It is a sort of standard in
  the way I "work"<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> and it is based on three things.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A good software to manage todo lists and documentation with
    hyperlinks and that is good to take quick notes in plain-text. I
    use emacs'org-mode; I heard vimwiki is a nice substitute if you
    are that kind of person.
</li>
<li>A simple way to document what I do and <b>what is left to do</b>
    intended to be as little cumbersome as possible; which implies
    having tools to automate annoying tasks.
</li>
<li>Having a schedule/subdivision of my tasks as flexible as possible;
    which also implies having tools to automate the update.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Overview of meuporg</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<p>It is a set of automatic tools to manage extract items
from the content of any text files you want and which will sort and
insert them in your todo list regardless of the format you use<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
It is assumed you have a unique file for each project at the root of
its directory tree in which you will put your todo lists, knowledge,
base, etc. This file is called the <b>main file</b>. Personnaly, I now go
back to the main file of my projects at least every 10-15min when I am
working: it helps me know where I am going and I update it very
regularly.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> Meuporg updates this file automatically by inserting
links to the very lines I have to modify/where I have to write
functions/whatever and putting these links in the relevant part of the
main file.
</p>
<p>
How can this be? you ask. Very simply, I shall answer. Right below,
you will find instructions explaining you how to install
meuporg. Then, you will have more explanations about how it works and
how it is intended to be used.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Install</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
Just go <a href="http://picarresursix.github.com/meuporg/">here</a>, download the archive, uncompress it and run the
<b>./install.sh</b> script (tested on ubuntu and mac OS). Advices are
given: you might want to add this alias to your .bashrc
</p>


<pre class="example">alias meuporg="python2.7 '$BASE_DIR'"'
</pre>

<p>
(*/$BASE_DIR/ will be replaced by the value you should put when
running the script) and, if you are wise enough to use emacs, adding
this to your .emacs would be a good idea
</p>


<pre class="example">(load "~/.emacs.d/meuporg.el")
</pre>

<p>
(the <i>meuporg.el</i> file is automatically moved in your .emacs.d folder
during installation).
</p>
<p>
Run the following command to "activate" your bash alias.
</p>


<pre class="example">you@yourcomputer~$ . .bashrc

<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> List items</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">

<p>The main feature of meuporg is its ability to keep track of what is
left to do from the content of your text files and put it in your todo
list automatically. The principle is very simple: all you have to do
is leave some particular snippets of text anywhere and meuporg will
find them, sort them and add them to a file with links pointing to
them.
</p>
<p>
The snippets of text you must put in your files ar called <b>items</b>. An
item is something like the content of the comment at the beginning of
the loop in this hypothetic file <b>src/myfunction.c</b>.
</p>


<pre class="example">int foo(unsigned int bar)
{
        // some code
        while (fuzzy_condition)
                // !TOCHECK! The loop condition in foo may not work if
                // ! some bar == 0.
        {
                process_bar();
        }
        return -4;
}
</pre>


<p>
An item always has the following structure.
</p><ul>
<li>An item always starts with a word enclosed in exclamation marks, it
   is the <b>name</b> of the item. No space or other non-alphanumeric
   characters are allowed.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</li>
<li>An item can be "in-code", in which case it contains no other
   information than its name because the data surrounding it is
   sufficient.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> It is the case if there is at least one alpha-numeric
   character on the same line before it.
</li>
<li>&hellip; Or it can have a description. The description of an item is
   what follows it on the same line. If you need more than one line,
   just start the next one with an exclamation mark.
</li>
<li>An item is also defined by its <b>location</b>, i.e. the file it is in
   an its line number. However, this is taken care of automatically.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
More info is given in <a href="#sec-6-1">Item structure</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the example, the item has these properties:
</p><ul>
<li>name: TOCHECK
</li>
<li>description: The loop condition in foo may not work if ! some
   bar == 0.
</li>
<li>location: ./src/myfunction.c, line 5.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The magical spell to retrieve all the items in a file or in the files
in a directory is the <b>meuporg</b> command. Run without any arguments to
see the help. The main options you can give it are the following.
</p><ul>
<li><b>-t TEMPLATE_STYLE</b>: (Template) TEMPLATE_STYLE has to be either
   'md', 'vimwiki' or 'org'. Creates a new meuporg main file in the
   said format in the current directory (see <a href="#Templates">Templates</a>).
</li>
<li><b>-f</b>: (main File) Returns the path to the main file of the
   directory (if any).
</li>
<li><b>-u</b>: (Update) Updates the main file ruling this directory (it
   might be in the parent directories).
</li>
</ul>


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Update the main file</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">

<p>If you run <b>meuporg -u</b>, it will "update the main file". This means
that meuporg will read the main file, deduce the files it should
parse, parse them to get all the items it finds and then insert these
in the main file.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-2-1"><span class="section-number-4">3.2.1</span> Configuration</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-1">

<p>The main file<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.6" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> contains a basic configuration for meuporg: it must
contain a line with "INCLUDE: " followed by a space separated list of
pattern and another with "EXCLUDE: " followed by a list of patterns.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The files whose name contains a string matching at least one of the
   patterns in the list following "INCLUDE" will be parsed. If you
   left items in other files, they will be ignored.

</li>
<li>The files whose name contains a string matching at least one of the
   patterns in the list following "EXCLUDE" will <b>not</b> be parsed. If you
   left items in these files, they will be ignored.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Exclusion has the priority: if you include files containing "cpp" but
exclude those containing "bla" then <i>bla.cpp</i> will be ignored.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-2-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-2-2"><span class="section-number-4">3.2.2</span> Listing items</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">

<p>To tell meuporg where it must insert the list of the items it found,
just add a heading with name "Items" anywhere in your file. Keep in
mind that the text in this heading will be discarded when the file is
updated. The rest however is untouched.
</p></div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Sort items</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">

<p>Meuporg does not simply list the items you left in a directory, it can
also sort them. Suppose you have two directories for your project:
<i>doc</i> and <i>src</i>. You might want meuporg to put items found in the
<i>doc</i> folder into one part of your main file and those found in <i>src</i>
in another. It couldn't be simpler: meuporg reads the names of the
headings in your main file and keeps them in mind. Thus, if you have
the following in your main file:
</p>


<pre class="example">* doc
The documentation of my awesome project.
** Items

** Useful links
I use some software for my documentation, here is a list of links:
 * [[http://example.com][bla]]
 * [[http://example.com][bli]]  
 
* src
** Items
</pre>

<p>
You also have some items in some files in your <i>doc</i> and <i>src</i>
directory. If you update this file, you will obtain this.
</p>


<pre class="example">* doc
The documentation of my awesome project.
** Items
*** TODO
  1. [[file:./doc/updateDoc.sh:20][Problem with the arguments of the script]]
*** IDEA
  1. [[file:./doc/updateDoc.sh:111][Rewrite this part and use a separate function.]]
  2. [[file:./doc/updateDoc.sh:130][Use getopt to parse the arguments.]]

** Useful links
I use some software for my documentation, here is a list of links:
 * [[http://example.com][bla]]
 * [[http://example.com][bli]]

* src
** Items
*** TODO
 1. [[file:./src/foo.cpp:23][Implement method foo.init()]]
 2. [[file:./src/foo.cpp:56][Implement method foo.doSomeThing()]]
 3. [[file:./src/foo.hpp:30][Write documentation of foo.init()]]
 4. [[file:./src/foo.hpp:60][Write documentation of foo.doSomeThing()]]
</pre>


<p>
You can pile up such criteria: if a "Items" heading is in a subsection
called "cpp" of a section called "src", only the items in files whose
path contain <b>both</b> "cpp" and "src" will end up under the "Items" heading.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, items appear only ones in the files. You should think of
your main file as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve">sieve</a>: if an item matches all the titles of a
chain of nested heading, then it will end up under the "Items" buried
inside these headings (if any).
</p>
<p>
Since it might be cumbersome to name your sections in the main file
after patterns (you can use python-style regex's by the way), there is
another to achieve this. If there is a parenthesis in a heading, its
content it used as a "filter" instead of the header. You can also put
several patterns separated by comma inside the parenthesis: items'
path will have to match all of them. Example.
</p>


<pre class="example">* Source code (src)
** headers and code (hpp,cpp)
*** Items
** other ()
*** Items
</pre>

<p>
The "Items" below "headers and code" will receive all items from files
in the <i>src</i> folder whose name contain <i>hpp</i> or <i>cpp</i>. The parenthesis
after "other" are empty so no pattern is added here: files need simply
to be in the <i>src</i> folder to end up in this section.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to make very easy to reorganize the items. Indeed, if you
suddenly want to have all your items in your files concerning tests
that are scattered in many parts of your directory tree, just add
heading with "test" in your file and a heading "Items" below it. All
items in files whose path contain "test", either as their name or as
the name of a parent folder, will be in it.

<p>
The syntax for adding items is dead simple and updating a file
requires only one command. Things can go even faster if you use emacs:
I have written a minor-mode to automate even more tasks.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.7" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> If the

very small size, then probably not.
</p>
<p>
If you work on projects that are spread throughout several
weeks/month/years due to their sizes or the amount of time you can
spend on them and/or if the said projects consist in editing text
files[],fn:8 then <b>yes</b>, you might want to give meup.org a try!

<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> "Work" refering to both my actual work and the code/documents I
write for fun on my spare time; such as Meup.org for instance.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> As long the format you use is either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode">org-mode</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2226">vimiwki</a> or
<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>. If there is another format you think is relevant, drop a
mail and I'll see what I can do. Even better: give it a try an
implement it yourself! The code is on <a href="https://github.com/picarresursix/meuporg">github</a>.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> That's actually one of the nice "side-effects" of meuporg:
since I spend a lot of time in the main file, I feel a lot more the
urge to keep it updated, in particular when it comes to maintaining
the knowledge base I put in all my main files.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.4" href="#fnr.4">4</a></sup> Right now, underscores are allowed as well but it seems to
cause problems with LaTeX (compiling fails) so I encourage you not to
use it. Consider this feature deprecated.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.5" href="#fnr.5">5</a></sup> I use a lot of such items named FIXREF when writing papers. I
don't need to put them on their own lines with explanations as for the
reference I need to insert: the context is sufficient.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.6" href="#fnr.6">6</a></sup> Some may argue that such a configuration belongs in another
file. They have a point but I consider that describing the files that
are part of the project and those that are not is useful not just for
the program but also for anyone working on the project. I thus decided
to include this info <b>in</b> the main file.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.7" href="#fnr.7">7</a></sup> By the way, if you write a plugin to integrate meuporg with
your editor of choice (vim?) or IDE or what not, let me know and I
will be happy to provide a link to it or to integrate it to meup.org.
