* Purpose

  If you never encountered these, you may throw the first stone.
  
  * Ever started a project, *left it aside* and took it again
    weeks/month/years later without understandig what you did? 
  * Ever managed a *big* project on your one, the kind that involves a
    hundred pages of LaTeX and/or thousands of lines of code?
  * Ever wondered *where* the hell that awesome info you found on the
    net was?

  These are problems I have faced. I now do keep a track of the links
  I found using emacs'org-mode but the files where I put these where
  basically a mess. Furthermore, I didn't have the courage, when
  writing some file, to go to the org-one, write what I had to do, put
  a link to the file I was working on, go back to the file I was
  working on. It's not a big deal but it is the kind of tiny thing
  which gets in the way and gets annoying.

  Meup.org is the solution I came up with. It is a sort of standard in
  the way I "work"[fn:1] and it is based on two things.

  * A good software to manage todo lists and documentation with
    hyperlinks and that is good to take quick notes in plain-text. I
    use emacs'org-mode; I heard vimwiki is a nice substitute if you
    are that kind of person.
  * A simple way to document what I do and *what is left to do*
    intended to be as little cumbersome as possible; which implies
    having tools to automate annoying tasks.

* Solution!

The solution to this problem has a name. Behold...

[[file:./logo.png]]

Aka meuporg.


* Features

!TODO! Write a list of features.


* Should I use Meup.org?

If you don't work with plain-text files; that is if you work with an
office suite such that libreoffice.org, microsoft office or whatever,
then no.

If your projects are not scattered on many files and are of very small
size, then probably not.

If you work on projects that are spread throughout several
weeks/month/years due to their sizes or the amount of time you can
spend on them and if the said projects consist in editing text
files[fn:2]

* Components

!TODO! Write intro of the "components" section.

** Template

!TODO! Write brief explanation with link to the corresponding file.


** Script

!TODO! Write brief explanation with link to the corresponding file.

** Emacs minor-mode

!TODO! Write brief explanation with link to the corresponding file.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] "Work" refering to both my actual work and the code/documents I
write for fun on my spare time; such as Meup.org for instance.

[fn:2] For instance, it is the case, if you do any sort of programming
without a big IDE like eclipse (no, emacs doesn't count as such).
