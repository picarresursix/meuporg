{"body":"# Meuporg\r\n\r\n## Meuporg is an Efficient and Unified Project ORGanization tool\r\n\r\nWe all have many projects we work on. In my case, I write a master thesis, I implement an open-source program, I write a math book, I manage a blog, I take care of my computer, etc. Nothing very impressive but all these tasks require me to organize myself. Furthermore, I don't work on all of them at the same time: it is fairly common for one of these projects to be on stand by for weeks, months even. They can also be big: while they remain manageable by a single person, I need a way to keep track of what is left to do, what possible improvements could be, etc. in order to be efficient right away when catching up.\r\n\r\nMeuporg is the solution I came up with.","note":"Don't delete this file!
