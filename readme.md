# Meuporg is an Efficient and Unified Project ORGanization tool #

Meuporg (`!M!`) allows to automatically keep a centralised track of
to-do items and notes associated with a project.

It creates a file like the following one in the blink of an eye using
data from the files in the same directory.
![The main file of my master thesis](https://raw.github.com/picarresursix/meuporg/master/example.png
"The main file of my master thesis"). Not only does it collect data
from all your files, it also allows you to insert sort and organize it
in any way you like in a very easy way.

Meuporg is intended to be used to manage one person projects. It is
free software (BSD licence): basically, you are free to
use/redistribute/do anything you want with it as long you give me
credit for designing it.



# Installation #

Get
[the archive containing all the data](https://github.com/picarresursix/meuporg/archive/master.zip)
and then uncompress it. If you run some UNIX derivative, `cd` in the
newly created directory and run the `install.sh` script.

## Notes ##

The name of this program comes from a nice joke by @tshirtman. A
French joke I'm afraid; "meuporg" being an attempt at transcripting
the awful pronunciation a French journalist used for the "MMORPG"
acronym. _sigh_...


## Modifying/Hacking ##

As you might guess since I put this project on github, feel free (and
further, encouraged) to use it! I would also love to hear your
comments: you can contact me via github or at `leoperrin [at/arobase]
picarresursix.fr`.
