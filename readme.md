*WORK in progress, use the "roadmap" part or my
 [regulus](https://github.com/picarresursix/regulus/) repository for now*

Meuporg
=======

Meuporg is a system I developed when writing my master thesis to keep
track of the things I have to do.

I used org-mode from the start when working, but I found that keeping
separated TODO-lists with vague indications as for where the
modifications had to be done was pretty cumbersome. I thought it would
be awesome to be able to leave a small description of what was left to
do in a file at the point where it was to be done and then to have a
list of these items built automatically with links pointing to the
exact place in the code were the modification has to be done. I also
wanted it to be very easy to use (remember it is intended to fight
cumbersomeness) so I wrote a small emacs minor-mode to go with it.

Org-mode allows to have hypertext links so it seemed rather
feasible. It turned out to be very possible indeed.

The first version of this system was called roadmap and relied on bash
instead of python. It used to be part of my
[regulus](https://github.com/picarresursix/regulus/) system.


The name of this program comes from a nice joke by
[tshirtman](https://github.com/tshirtman/). A French joke I'm afraid.


Example
=======

<!--
!TODO! Show a screen cap of the meup.org file of this
! project.
-->


Principle
=========

### Items ###

<!--
!TODO! Write description of what an item is, its structure and
! how it is displayed.
!IDEA! Some thoughts on what a good item is might be nice.
 -->
 
### Meuporg.py ###

<!--
!TODO! Describe what the python script does.
-->


### meuporg-mode ###

<!--
!TODO! Describe how the meuporg-mode must be set up and how it is
! used (features and associated shortcuts).
-->


Modifying/Hacking
=================

As you might guess since I put this project on github, feel free (and
further, encouraged) to use it! I would also love to hear your
comments: you can contact me via github or at `leoperrin
[at/arobase] picarresursix.fr`.
